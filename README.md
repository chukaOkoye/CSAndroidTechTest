### My Approach
- A credit check app that pulls and displays credit score information from an endpoint. I decided to use Jetpack Compose to create the UI because of it's simplicity, which allowed me to focus on the viewModels and data layer of the app to adhere by MVVM principles.
- Managed to create a UI test for the credit score, and if I had more time would complete the unit test for the viewModel.
- Made the app scalable by including the other credit report data points that I believed would be beneficial for the user, days until next report and credit utilisation score etc. With the hope of displaying such information on another page.
